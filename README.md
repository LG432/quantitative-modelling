# quantitative-modelling

This repository documents my self-directed journey into quantitative finance and statistical modeling, starting from first principles. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Physics & Astronomy, and I'm transitioning into quantitative roles by building a solid foundation in probability, statistics, and Python-based simulation.

## Contents

Each notebook in this repo tackles a fundamental concept using simulation and visualization:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLT_fair_dice.ipynb` | Demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using fair dice. Shows how the sample mean of uniform distributions approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases. |
| `CLT_unfair_dice.ipynb` | Applies CLT to a biased die with non-uniform probabilities. Explores how sample mean distributions behave when the underlying data is skewed. |
| *(Coming soon)* `03_simulated_stock_returns.ipynb` | Simulates log-normal stock price paths and visualizes return distributions. Bridges statistical concepts with financial modeling. |
